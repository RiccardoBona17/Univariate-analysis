<h1 align="center" id="title">UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF FUNCTIONAL LOCALIZER</h1>

<p id="description">This repository contains the MATLAB scripts created to preprocess and analyze fMRI data acquired during a functional localizer task as a part of my internship experience.</p>
<p id="second_description"> In designing these scripts, I mostly relied on the SPM software and other programs for ROI generation.</p>

<p id="thanks"> Hope you enjoy!</p>
